# RESIDENTAL-ASSISTANT-HELPER

This project is to assist me in my daily function as a Resident Assistant(RA). A major function I undertake is to interact with over 40 Residents and get to know them. I have intentional conversations and forward them to my supervisor who gives me action items to complete about concerns she may have about the resident. Whether it be personal, academic or other. Another function is to create community interaction. This project will help with these tasks by accepting all of the data about a resident sorting through tags (which are interest they have, or other information told to me) and analyzing it and outputting it in a readable way that will help me to identify common interest among my residents. As an RA we have a list of tasks to complete and events occurring this project will give me a list of task and the due date. Also, it will give me resident specific task like “check up on mark’s classes”. There is also a feature that will output information on a student that is strictly for the student’s parents this will have less information than what is available to the RA.
